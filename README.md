## 🚀 Current Projects

### Metahuman_Attention

[Metahuman_Attention](https://github.com/hsantos10/Metahuman_Attention)  
A project focused on analyzing human motion data using deep learning. It processes marker data (TRC files) and kinematic/dynamic data (MOT/STO files) to train LSTM models with attention mechanisms for predicting biomechanical variables. Features include:
- Data ingestion and preprocessing for biomechanics file formats
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- LSTM with integrated attention (additive/dot-product, bidirectional options)
- Training and evaluation pipelines with detailed metrics
- Metadata integration for personalized predictions
- Visualization of model performance

### 3D Indoor Mapping with Autonomous Drones

Co-designed a system for 3D indoor mapping in GPS-denied environments using multiple unmanned aircraft systems, contributing to the NIST 5.0 UAS drone challenge to aid first responders.

### N-Dimensional Tensor Compression

Researched and designed machine learning and compression algorithms for n-dimensional tensors, focusing on efficient data representation and analysis.

### IoT and Embedded Systems

- Developed IoT solutions for real-time monitoring and control in transportation and smart environments.
- Led teams to design and launch cost-effective IoT devices for automation and data collection in both industry and academia.
